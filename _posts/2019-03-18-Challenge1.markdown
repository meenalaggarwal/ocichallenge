* [Oracle Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.oracle.com/containers/kubernetes-engine)

## What will we Verify here : 
* Have you created a `separate compartment`, and a `user-group` and `user`  with privileges and `policies` to work in only that compartment ?
>  Why ? Because we don't want you messing with other people's work and vice versa
* Spin up the Kubernetes Cluster in the compartment with the User ID 

## Submission format: 
* The `KUBECONFIG` File 
* The credentials of the User created in the `Oracle Cloud Account` in a password protected Zip file
* A Write Up with 5 Bullet points not exceeding 50 words in each point, about the Key Differentiation factors of Oracle Kubernetes engine over AKS and EKS
