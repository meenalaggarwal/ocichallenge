About this Challenge
---

This challenge is to verify your ability to 
* Use Helm to Deploy Prometheus and Grafana to setup Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring
* Show a dashboard along with alerts on Slack whenever a metric crosses threshold

## About Prometheus
* Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting specializing in Time Series Data
* Prometheus scrapes your Kubernetes Cluster Metrics and stores this information in Memory/ in Disk
* Use this link to understand more about  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)

## About Grafana
* Grafana is an open source platform for Time Series Analytics 
* Use this link to understand more about  [Grafana](http://docs.grafana.org/)

## How do I get started with Helm
* If you have setup the Kubernetes Cluster successfully, The Server Side of Helm ( Tiller ) comes pre-installed in OKE

### To setup the Client Side of Helm, 
* Setup chocolatey on your `Windows` laptop. For `Mac and Linux` Skip this step
* Install Chocolatey by running this on
PowerShell as an admin

    ~~~~~~~ powershell
    @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
    ~~~~~~~

* Setup Kubernetes-cli by running this command

    ~~~~~~~~~ powershell
    choco install kubernetes-cli
    ~~~~~~~~~

* Copy the `KUBECONFIG` file to the required location
* Setup Helm Client by running this command

    ~~~~~~~~~ powershell
    choco install kubernetes-helm
    ~~~~~~~~~

* Run 

    ~~~~~~~~~ powershell
    helm init 
    ~~~~~~~~~
* If Helm is successfully setup without errors you are now free to deploy the MongoDB Chart

## Deploy MongoDB-HA

### Create namespace

    kubectl create namespace <Your FirstName>

### Deploy code
    
    helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
    helm install --name <Your LastName> --namespace <Your FirstName> stable/mongodb-replicaset

## What will we Verify here : 
* Have you successfully deployed the Mongo-DB Cluster using helm status
* Verify if all Pods are in running state and verify connectivity from within the cluster in MongoDB

## Submission Format: 
* A Write Up with 5 Bullet points not exceeding 50 words in each point, about the `learnings while **deploying on Kubernetes**` using `**helm**`. 
* Send your Email with 
  * `Subject Line: OCI Challenge-4`  **< Your Name >**
  * `Email Recepients:` **[Vamsi](mailto:vamsi.ramakrishnan@oracle.com) && [Laksh](mailto:lakshmikanth.vasudevamurthy@oracle.com)**
