* Create 2 separate build and deployment pipelines for the frontend and backend.
* You would have to push your build artifacts to OCIR (Registry) and fetch them during the deployment process.

## What will we Verify here : 
* Have you setup the Build and Deployment Pipeline as described in the Wercker.yml file
