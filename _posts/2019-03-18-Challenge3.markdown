## About the steps
* If you checkout your Repos `ora-se-symposium-front-end` and `ora-se-symposium-backend` you will see a `Wercker.yml` file which has the CI/CD Pipeline defined in it. 
* Make sure you create these two applications within Wercker
* You would have to give your `Oracle Cloud ID` to associate it with `Developer Cloud Service` where your repositories reside

## What will we Verify here : 
* Have you setup the Build and Deployment Pipeline as described in the `Wercker.yml` file
* Provide Read-Only Access to as Team members
